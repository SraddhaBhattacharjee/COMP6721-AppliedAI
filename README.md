Chest X-rays are the most commonly used medical imaging modality and their interpretation can be a time-consuming, challenging, and errorprone process, even for expert radiologists to accurately diagnose diseases. The advancement of AI has triggered a significant transformation in the field of Healthcare, thus, our project aims to utilize state-of-the-art AI models, to assist in the diagnosis of respiratory and cardiovascular conditions in patients. 

We seek to train advanced Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) (AlexNet, ResNet18, and Inceptionv3), with Chest X-Ray images, to compare the performance metrics of these AI models to identify the underlying trends in the data and to diagnose abnormalities accurately.
